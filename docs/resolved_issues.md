**Issue ID:** TEST-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Incomplete Test Coverage for Feature Generation. `feature_generator.py` lacked full test coverage.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-19, 100% test coverage is achieved for all current and future functions in `feature_generator.py`. All edge cases and error handling are covered in `tests/test_feature_generator.py`. A process is in place to require new features to be accompanied by new tests.

**Issue ID:** LOG-001
**Original Description (Concise):** `src/data_loader.py` and `src/feature_generator.py` lacked structured logging for key operations and error conditions. This impeded observability and debugging.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-19, structured logging was added to `src/feature_generator.py` and `src/data_loader.py`. Logging configuration centralized in `configs/logging_config.py`.

**Last Reopened Date:**
**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Structured logging has been added to all error conditions and critical operations in all core modules. Logging configuration is centralized in `configs/logging_config.py`. Documentation has been updated. All new modules and functions must include structured logging.

**Issue ID:** TEST-002
**Original Description (Concise):** Tests for log messages using pytest's `caplog` fixture were failing because they incorrectly accessed log records through `caplog.text` instead of `caplog.records`.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** Tests now properly access individual log records via `caplog.records` and check message attributes for expected substrings. Documentation has been added to `docs/src/config_parser.py.md` about the proper way to capture and assert log messages in tests.
