**Issue ID:** TEST-002
**Original Description (Concise):** Tests for log messages using pytest's `caplog` fixture were failing because they incorrectly accessed log records through `caplog.text` instead of `caplog.records`.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** Tests now properly access individual log records via `caplog.records` and check message attributes for expected substrings. Documentation has been added to `docs/src/config_parser.py.md` about the proper way to capture and assert log messages in tests.

**Issue ID:** CODE-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Code Duplication in `src/backtester.py`. The `PortfolioData` NamedTuple was defined twice, identically, within the file at lines 16-25 and 27-36, violating DRY principles.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, removed the duplicate definition of `PortfolioData` NamedTuple while maintaining all functionality and test coverage. The module now has a single, clean definition of the `PortfolioData` class.

**Issue ID:** API-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Architectural Degeneration in Test Suite. The test suite for the feature generator primarily targeted legacy alias functions (calculate_*) instead of designated primary API functions (add_*). This created a dangerous disconnect between testing strategy and documented API design.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, refactored all parameterized tests in tests/test_feature_generator.py to directly call the primary add_* functions. Created a separate, minimal test for legacy calculate_* functions that verifies they correctly delegate to the corresponding add_* function.

**Issue ID:** DESIGN-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Design Deviation & Documentation Mismatch for Feature Generation Orchestration. The `generate_features` function in `src/feature_generator.py` was implemented with a different signature and behavior than specified in `docs/design.md`, leading to documentation inconsistency.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, updated `docs/design.md` to reflect the actual implemented behavior of `generate_features` which uses a more flexible feature_config approach instead of the originally designed strategy_params approach.

**Issue ID:** IMPORT-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Non-Standard Import Practices in `tests/test_backtester.py`. The test file used dynamic imports (importlib.util.spec_from_file_location) to load the backtester.py module from the src/ directory, making the test setup less standard and potentially more brittle.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, updated `tests/test_backtester.py` to use standard import statements (from src import backtester) consistent with the project's structure and Python import conventions.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Updated `docs/design.md` to accurately reflect the implementation of `generate_features`. This ensures consistency between documentation and code, reducing confusion for developers. The implemented approach (feature_config) was determined to be superior to the originally designed approach (strategy_params) due to its flexibility and extensibility. Updated `docs/design.md` Section 4.4 to match the implemented behavior in `src/feature_generator.py`. The implemented feature_config approach was determined to be superior to the originally designed strategy_params approach as it provides better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation. The documentation now correctly describes the function signature as `generate_features(df: pd.DataFrame, feature_config: dict) -> pd.DataFrame` and explains how the feature_config dictionary is used to generate features.

**Issue ID:** TEST-004
**Original Description (Concise):** Suboptimal Test Implementation in `test_feature_generator.py`. The test dynamically recalculated expected values for `calculate_volatility` and `calculate_price_change_pct` within the test execution flow instead of comparing against static, pre-defined expected values.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, refactored all tests to use static, pre-calculated expected values rather than dynamic recalculation. This ensures independent verification of function correctness and prevents masking bugs between test and implementation logic.

**Issue ID:** API-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Dual Interfaces and Documentation Mismatch in `data_loader.py`. Two similar public functions (`fetch_data` and `fetch`) existed with disparate feature sets, potentially causing API confusion for developers.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, enhanced `fetch_data` to include all capabilities of `fetch` (column selection, cache control), made `fetch` a thin wrapper around `fetch_data` for backward compatibility, and updated all relevant documentation.

**Issue ID:** ERR-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Column Name Conflict Handling in `feature_generator.py`. The `_add_feature` function did not properly handle column name conflicts when joining features to the DataFrame, which could result in silent overwriting of existing columns.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, implemented proper column conflict resolution that renames columns with sequential suffixes when conflicts occur, with appropriate logging of these actions.

**Last Reopened Date:**
**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Implemented column name conflict resolution in the `_add_feature` function. When a generated feature's column name already exists in the DataFrame, the function now automatically renames the new column by appending a numerical suffix (e.g., `sma_3_1`, `sma_3_2`) to avoid overwriting existing data. Added appropriate logging for column conflicts. Fixed a test function that was missing the `caplog` parameter and updated documentation in `docs/src/feature_generator.py.md` to describe the conflict resolution behavior.

**Issue ID:** ARCH-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Architectural Inconsistency in Strategy Implementation. The `apply_strategy` function used a hardcoded if/else structure to handle different strategy types, which did not leverage the existing `BaseStrategy` class intended for a Strategy pattern implementation.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, the Strategy pattern has been properly implemented: a clear interface in `BaseStrategy` with abstract methods, concrete strategy implementations (e.g., `SMACrossoverStrategy`), a strategy registry for dynamic instantiation, and refactored `apply_strategy` to use this pattern. The `generate_sma_crossover_signals` function has been maintained for backward compatibility but now uses the new `SMACrossoverStrategy` internally.

**Issue ID:** DOC-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Documentation Veracity Failure in `docs/tasks.md`. Tasks 20, 21, and 22 in the Backtester Module were marked as incomplete [ ] despite being fully implemented in `src/backtester.py` with comprehensive test coverage, violating Core Engineering Principle #6.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, updated task completion statuses to accurately reflect implementation reality: Tasks 20 (trade execution simulation), 21 (trade logging functionality), and 22 (backtester tests) marked as complete with detailed descriptions. Progress summary corrected from 19/30 (63%) to 22/30 (73%). Systemic prevention measures mandated for future documentation-code synchronization.

**Issue ID:** TEST-005
**Original Description (Concise):** Test Logic Flaw (Incorrect Assertion) in `test_backtester.py`. The test was asserting that `portfolio_data.cash_pct.iloc[1] < 5.0` after a buy operation, when it should expect exactly 0.0% cash (as all cash is converted to equity).
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, updated `test_portfolio_composition_tracking()` to use precise assertions that match the exact expected behavior: `assert portfolio_data.cash_pct.iloc[1] == 0.0` and `assert portfolio_data.equity_pct.iloc[1] == 100.0`. Updated all relevant documentation to reflect this precise behavior.

**Issue ID:** TEST-006
**Original Description (Concise):** Test Code Quality Degradation in `tests/test_data_loader.py`. The test file contained two nearly identical, extensive sets of tests: one for the legacy `fetch` function and one for the primary `fetch_data` function, violating the DRY principle.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, refactored `tests/test_data_loader.py` to remove all redundant tests for the `fetch` function, keeping only the single, targeted test `test_fetch_delegates_to_fetch_data` that verifies the wrapper's behavior.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Removed all redundant tests for the `fetch` function while keeping the comprehensive test suite for the primary `fetch_data` function. Retained only the single test that verifies the `fetch` function correctly delegates to `fetch_data`. This significantly reduced code duplication while maintaining full functional coverage of the API.

**Issue ID:** TEST-007
**Original Description (Concise):** Test Logic Flaw (Incorrect Expected Value) in `tests/test_feature_generator.py`. The expected value for `add_volatility_nday` with window=3 at index 3 (5.924143874124078) was claimed to be incorrect, with 5.821536039701941 suggested as the correct value.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, verified through multiple calculation methods that the original expected value 5.924143874124078 was actually correct. The issue was a false positive.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Verified that the original test code was correct. The expected value of 5.924143874124078 was validated using both pandas' rolling standard deviation and manual calculation. The suggested "correct" value of 5.821536039701941 was found to be erroneous. No changes were required to the test or implementation code, as both were already functioning correctly with proper validation.

**Issue ID:** INPUT-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Missing Input Validation in `src/feature_generator.py`. The `add_sma` function did not explicitly check if the input column is numeric before attempting the .rolling().mean() operation, inconsistent with other similar functions in the same module.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, added explicit validation using `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[column])` to the `add_sma` function, with appropriate error logging and raising a clear ValueError, consistent with other functions in the module.

**Issue ID:** TEST-008
**Original Description (Concise):** Standalone Integration Test Not Integrated into Test Suite. The `integration_test.py` script in the root directory was not integrated into the pytest test suite and used the legacy API.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-24, refactored the standalone integration test into proper pytest test functions in `tests/test_integration.py` that use the recommended `apply_strategy` API. The integrated tests cover feature generation and strategy implementation, including backward compatibility and multiple feature types.
