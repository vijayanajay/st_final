**Issue ID:** TEST-002
**Original Description (Concise):** Tests for log messages using pytest's `caplog` fixture were failing because they incorrectly accessed log records through `caplog.text` instead of `caplog.records`.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** Tests now properly access individual log records via `caplog.records` and check message attributes for expected substrings. Documentation has been added to `docs/src/config_parser.py.md` about the proper way to capture and assert log messages in tests.

**Issue ID:** TEST-003
**Original Description (Concise):** Critical Test Coverage Gap & Documentation Discrepancy. The `apply_strategy` function in `src/strategies.py` was reported as untested, with documentation referring to a test file (`tests/test_apply_strategy.py`) that was claimed to be missing.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, verified that `tests/test_apply_strategy.py` does exist and contains comprehensive tests for the `apply_strategy` function. All tests pass successfully. The issue was a misunderstanding in the audit process.

**Issue ID:** DESIGN-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Design Deviation & Documentation Mismatch for Feature Generation Orchestration. The `generate_features` function in `src/feature_generator.py` was implemented with a different signature and behavior than specified in `docs/design.md`, leading to documentation inconsistency.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, updated `docs/design.md` to reflect the actual implemented behavior of `generate_features` which uses a more flexible feature_config approach instead of the originally designed strategy_params approach.

**Issue ID:** IMPORT-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Non-Standard Import Practices in `tests/test_backtester.py`. The test file used dynamic imports (importlib.util.spec_from_file_location) to load the backtester.py module from the src/ directory, making the test setup less standard and potentially more brittle.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, updated `tests/test_backtester.py` to use standard import statements (from src import backtester) consistent with the project's structure and Python import conventions.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Modified `tests/test_backtester.py` to use standard import statements (from src import backtester) instead of dynamic imports with importlib. This change makes the test setup more standard and consistent with other test files in the project. Verified that tests still pass after the change.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Updated `docs/design.md` to accurately reflect the implementation of `generate_features`. This ensures consistency between documentation and code, reducing confusion for developers. The implemented approach (feature_config) was determined to be superior to the originally designed approach (strategy_params) due to its flexibility and extensibility. Updated `docs/design.md` Section 4.4 to match the implemented behavior in `src/feature_generator.py`. The implemented feature_config approach was determined to be superior to the originally designed strategy_params approach as it provides better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation. The documentation now correctly describes the function signature as `generate_features(df: pd.DataFrame, feature_config: dict) -> pd.DataFrame` and explains how the feature_config dictionary is used to generate features.

**Issue ID:** TEST-004
**Original Description (Concise):** Suboptimal Test Implementation in `test_feature_generator.py`. The test dynamically recalculated expected values for `calculate_volatility` and `calculate_price_change_pct` within the test execution flow instead of comparing against static, pre-defined expected values.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, refactored all tests to use static, pre-calculated expected values rather than dynamic recalculation. This ensures independent verification of function correctness and prevents masking bugs between test and implementation logic.

**Issue ID:** API-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Dual Interfaces and Documentation Mismatch in `data_loader.py`. Two similar public functions (`fetch_data` and `fetch`) existed with disparate feature sets, potentially causing API confusion for developers.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, enhanced `fetch_data` to include all capabilities of `fetch` (column selection, cache control), made `fetch` a thin wrapper around `fetch_data` for backward compatibility, and updated all relevant documentation.

**Issue ID:** ERR-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Column Name Conflict Handling in `feature_generator.py`. The `_add_feature` function did not properly handle column name conflicts when joining features to the DataFrame, which could result in silent overwriting of existing columns.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, implemented proper column conflict resolution that renames columns with sequential suffixes when conflicts occur, with appropriate logging of these actions.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Implemented column name conflict resolution in the `_add_feature` function. When a generated feature's column name already exists in the DataFrame, the function now automatically renames the new column by appending a numerical suffix (e.g., `sma_3_1`, `sma_3_2`) to avoid overwriting existing data. Added appropriate logging for column conflicts. Fixed a test function that was missing the `caplog` parameter and updated documentation in `docs/src/feature_generator.py.md` to describe the conflict resolution behavior.

**Issue ID:** ARCH-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Architectural Inconsistency in Strategy Implementation. The `apply_strategy` function used a hardcoded if/else structure to handle different strategy types, which did not leverage the existing `BaseStrategy` class intended for a Strategy pattern implementation.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, the Strategy pattern has been properly implemented: a clear interface in `BaseStrategy` with abstract methods, concrete strategy implementations (e.g., `SMACrossoverStrategy`), a strategy registry for dynamic instantiation, and refactored `apply_strategy` to use this pattern. The `generate_sma_crossover_signals` function has been maintained for backward compatibility but now uses the new `SMACrossoverStrategy` internally.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Implemented a proper Strategy pattern in the strategies module, allowing for extensible strategy implementations without modifying the `apply_strategy` function. All existing tests continue to pass, and new tests have been added to verify the Strategy pattern implementation.
