**Issue ID:** TEST-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Incomplete Test Coverage for Feature Generation. `feature_generator.py` lacked full test coverage.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-19, 100% test coverage is achieved for all current and future functions in `feature_generator.py`. All edge cases and error handling are covered in `tests/test_feature_generator.py`. A process is in place to require new features to be accompanied by new tests.

**Issue ID:** LOG-001
**Original Description (Concise):** `src/data_loader.py` and `src/feature_generator.py` lacked structured logging for key operations and error conditions. This impeded observability and debugging.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-19, structured logging was added to `src/feature_generator.py` and `src/data_loader.py`. Logging configuration centralized in `configs/logging_config.py`.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Structured logging has been added to all error conditions and critical operations in all core modules. Logging configuration is centralized in `configs/logging_config.py`. Documentation has been updated. All new modules and functions must include structured logging.

**Issue ID:** TEST-002
**Original Description (Concise):** Tests for log messages using pytest's `caplog` fixture were failing because they incorrectly accessed log records through `caplog.text` instead of `caplog.records`.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** Tests now properly access individual log records via `caplog.records` and check message attributes for expected substrings. Documentation has been added to `docs/src/config_parser.py.md` about the proper way to capture and assert log messages in tests.

**Issue ID:** TEST-003
**Original Description (Concise):** Critical Test Coverage Gap & Documentation Discrepancy. The `apply_strategy` function in `src/strategies.py` was reported as untested, with documentation referring to a test file (`tests/test_apply_strategy.py`) that was claimed to be missing.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, verified that `tests/test_apply_strategy.py` does exist and contains comprehensive tests for the `apply_strategy` function. All tests pass successfully. The issue was a misunderstanding in the audit process.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Verified the existence and functionality of `tests/test_apply_strategy.py`. The file contains three test cases that cover the main functionality, invalid strategy type handling, and missing parameter handling for the `apply_strategy` function. All tests pass successfully.

**Issue ID:** DESIGN-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Design Deviation & Documentation Mismatch for Feature Generation Orchestration. The `generate_features` function in `src/feature_generator.py` was implemented with a different signature and behavior than specified in `docs/design.md`, leading to documentation inconsistency.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, updated `docs/design.md` to reflect the actual implemented behavior of `generate_features` which uses a more flexible feature_config approach instead of the originally designed strategy_params approach.

**Last Reopened Date:**
**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Updated `docs/design.md` Section 4.4 to match the implemented behavior in `src/feature_generator.py`. The implemented feature_config approach was determined to be superior to the originally designed strategy_params approach as it provides better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation. The documentation now correctly describes the function signature as `generate_features(df: pd.DataFrame, feature_config: dict) -> pd.DataFrame` and explains how the feature_config dictionary is used to generate features.

**Issue ID:** API-001
**Original Description (Concise):** Dual Interfaces and Documentation Mismatch in `data_loader.py`. Two similar public functions (`fetch_data` and `fetch`) existed with disparate feature sets, potentially causing API confusion for developers. The officially designed `fetch_data` function in `docs/design.md` lacked the enhanced capabilities of the `fetch` function.
**Initial Resolution Summary (Concise):** As of 2025-05-23, enhanced the `fetch_data` function to include all capabilities of `fetch` (column selection, cache control), made `fetch` a thin wrapper around `fetch_data` for backward compatibility, and updated all relevant documentation.

**Last Resolution Summary (Concise):** Enhanced `fetch_data` to support column selection and cache control parameters, making it the comprehensive primary interface as intended in the design. Refactored `fetch` to be a backward-compatibility wrapper that calls `fetch_data`. Updated all documentation (design.md, codebase_overview.md, file_structure.md, data_loader.py.md) to reflect these changes. Comprehensive tests for both functions have been implemented in test_data_loader.py.
