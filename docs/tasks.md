# Stock Strategy Backtester Implementation Tasks

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation tasks for the Simple Stock Strategy Backtester (S3B) as described in the PRD. Each task is designed to be completed in 1-2 hours and follows the Kailash Nadh principles of simplicity, functionality first, and minimalism.

## Progress Summary
**Total Tasks**: 30  
**Completed**: 12  
**Remaining**: 18  
**Progress**: 40%

## Tasks

### Project Setup (3/3)

2. [x] **Initialize project with requirements.txt** - Add required dependencies: pandas, numpy, yfinance, pyyaml
3. [x] **Create basic project documentation** - Set up README.md with project overview and setup instructions

### Data Fetching Module (3/3)
4. [x] **Create data_loader.py with fetch function** - Implement function to fetch historical stock data using yfinance
5. [x] **Add data validation and error handling** - Ensure proper handling of API errors and data consistency
6. [x] **Write tests for data_loader.py** - Create pytest tests to verify data fetching functionality

### Feature Generation Module (4/4)
7. [x] **Create feature_generator.py with SMA calculation** - Implement function to calculate Simple Moving Averages
8. [x] **Add price change percentage calculation** - Implement function for 1-day price change percentage
9. [x] **Add volatility calculation** - Implement rolling standard deviation of price changes
10. [x] **Write tests for feature_generator.py** - Create pytest tests for feature calculations

### Strategy Configuration (2/3)
11. [x] **Create config parser utility** - Implement YAML config file parser (`src/config_parser.py`)
12. [ ] **Create sample strategy config file** - Create sma_cross.yaml with configuration parameters
13. [x] **Write tests for config parsing** - Create pytest tests to verify config loading and parsing (see `tests/test_config_parser.py`).

### Strategy Implementation (0/4)
14. [ ] **Create strategies.py module** - Set up base structure for strategy implementations
15. [ ] **Implement SMA crossover strategy** - Create function for SMA crossover signal generation
16. [ ] **Add signal generation utility** - Create function to apply strategy to dataframe and generate signals
17. [ ] **Write tests for strategies.py** - Create pytest tests for strategy implementations

### Backtester Module (0/5)
18. [ ] **Create backtester.py with simulation structure** - Set up framework for simulating trades
19. [ ] **Implement portfolio tracking** - Add functionality to track portfolio value over time
20. [ ] **Add trade execution simulation** - Implement logic to execute trades based on signals
21. [ ] **Create trade logging functionality** - Implement detailed logging of trade activities
22. [ ] **Write tests for backtester.py** - Create pytest tests for backtesting functionality

### Performance Metrics Module (0/4)
23. [ ] **Create metrics.py with basic return calculations** - Implement total and annualized return metrics
24. [ ] **Add drawdown and trade metrics** - Implement max drawdown, win rate, and trade count metrics
25. [ ] **Add risk/reward metrics** - Implement Sharpe ratio and profit factor calculations
26. [ ] **Write tests for metrics.py** - Create pytest tests for performance metrics calculations

### Main Application (0/3)
27. [ ] **Create main.py entry point** - Implement main script with configurable constants
28. [ ] **Integrate all modules into workflow** - Connect all components into a complete backtesting pipeline
29. [ ] **Add console output formatting** - Implement clear, readable console output for results

### Documentation (0.5/1)
30. [~] **Create detailed module documentation** - Module documentation for `config_parser.py` and related test/usage notes have been added. Full documentation for all modules is still in progress.

## Definition of Done

Each task is considered complete when:
- The code is written and functioning as described in the PRD
- Tests are passing (where applicable)
- Documentation is updated
- Code follows PEP 8 guidelines and project principles
- Code review (self or peer) is complete
- Each file remains under 500 lines of code (refactored if necessary)

---

**Recent Updates (2025-05-20):**
- Config parser utility and its tests are complete and fully documented.
- Logging and testability for config parsing are now robust and standardized.
- Documentation for `config_parser.py` and log testing approach added to `docs/`.
