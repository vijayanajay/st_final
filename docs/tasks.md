# Stock Strategy Backtester Implementation Tasks

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation tasks for the Simple Stock Strategy Backtester (S3B) as described in the PRD. Each task is designed to be completed in 1-2 hours and follows the Kailash Nadh principles of simplicity, functionality first, and minimalism.

## Progress Summary
**Total Tasks**: 30  
**Completed**: 22  
**Remaining**: 8  
**Progress**: 73%

## Tasks

9. [x] **Add volatility calculation** - Implement rolling standard deviation of price changes
10. [x] **Write tests for feature_generator.py** - Create pytest tests for feature calculations


### Strategy Implementation (3/4)
14. [x] **Create strategies.py module** - Set up base structure for strategy implementations. File: `src/strategies.py`. Test File: `tests/test_strategies.py`. Docs: `docs/src/strategies.py.md`
15. [x] **Implement SMA crossover strategy** - Create function for SMA crossover signal generation
16. [x] **Add signal generation utility** - Create function to apply strategy to dataframe and generate signals. File: `src/strategies.py`. Test File: `tests/test_apply_strategy.py`. Implemented and tested.
17. [x] **Write tests for strategies.py** - Create pytest tests for strategy implementations

### Backtester Module (5/5)
18. [x] **Create backtester.py with simulation structure** - Set up framework for simulating trades based on strategy signals. Implemented with comprehensive TDD approach covering position tracking, trade execution, and portfolio valuation.
19. [x] **Implement portfolio tracking** - Add functionality to track portfolio value over time. ✅ **COMPLETE** - Enhanced portfolio tracking implemented with detailed composition analysis, returns calculation, and drawdown metrics using TDD methodology. Both basic and enhanced tracking modes available with full backward compatibility.
20. [x] **Add trade execution simulation** - Implement logic to execute trades based on signals. ✅ **COMPLETE** - Full trade execution logic implemented in `_process_trading_signals()` with buy/sell signal processing, position management, and portfolio valuation.
21. [x] **Create trade logging functionality** - Implement detailed logging of trade activities. ✅ **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive trade logging captures buy_price, sell_price, shares, and profit for each completed trade.
22. [x] **Write tests for backtester.py** - Create pytest tests for backtesting functionality. ✅ **COMPLETE** - 22 comprehensive tests covering all trading scenarios, portfolio analytics, edge cases, and enhanced tracking features.

### Performance Metrics Module (0/4)
23. [ ] **Create metrics.py with basic return calculations** - Implement total and annualized return metrics
24. [ ] **Add drawdown and trade metrics** - Implement max drawdown, win rate, and trade count metrics
25. [ ] **Add risk/reward metrics** - Implement Sharpe ratio and profit factor calculations
26. [ ] **Write tests for metrics.py** - Create pytest tests for performance metrics calculations

### Main Application (0/3)
27. [ ] **Create main.py entry point** - Implement main script with configurable constants
28. [ ] **Integrate all modules into workflow** - Connect all components into a complete backtesting pipeline
29. [ ] **Add console output formatting** - Implement clear, readable console output for results

### Documentation (0.5/1)
30. [~] **Create detailed module documentation** - Module documentation for `config_parser.py` and related test/usage notes have been added. Full documentation for all modules is still in progress.

## Definition of Done

Each task is considered complete when:
- The code is written and functioning as described in the PRD
- Tests are passing (where applicable)
- Documentation is updated
- Code follows PEP 8 guidelines and project principles
- Code review (self or peer) is complete
- Each file remains under 500 lines of code (refactored if necessary)
