## RESOLVED ISSUES

All previously documented architectural directives (TEST-001, LOG-001, TEST-002) were confirmed as RESOLVED as of 2025-05-20. The TEST-003 issue identified on 2025-05-23 has been RESOLVED. The DESIGN-001 issue related to feature generation orchestration identified on 2025-05-23 has been RESOLVED. Refer to `resolved_issues.md` for details.

## PARTIALLY RESOLVED/REGRESSED ISSUES

_None at this time._

## NEW CRITICAL FLAWS (Identified This Audit)

**TEST-004 (RESOLVED):** Insufficient Test Coverage for `apply_strategy` Function. The `apply_strategy` function in `src/strategies.py` had inadequate test coverage, missing tests for different column names, empty DataFrames, DataFrames with NaNs, and proper logging verification. This issue has been RESOLVED by implementing comprehensive tests in `tests/test_apply_strategy.py` that cover all these scenarios.

**API-001 (RESOLVED):** Dual Interfaces and Documentation Mismatch in `data_loader.py`. Two similar public functions (`fetch_data` and `fetch`) existed with disparate feature sets, potentially causing API confusion for developers. The officially designed `fetch_data` function in `docs/design.md` lacked the enhanced capabilities of the `fetch` function. This issue has been RESOLVED by enhancing `fetch_data` to include all capabilities of `fetch` (column selection, cache control), making `fetch` a thin wrapper around `fetch_data` for backward compatibility, and updating all relevant documentation.

## RESOLVED CRITICAL FLAWS (This Audit)

**DESIGN-001 (RESOLVED):** Design Deviation & Documentation Mismatch for Feature Generation Orchestration. The `generate_features` function in `src/feature_generator.py` was implemented with a different signature and behavior than specified in `docs/design.md`. This issue has been RESOLVED by updating the design documentation to match the implemented behavior, which was determined to be superior to the original design.

## AUDIT NOTES
- All code and documentation changes related to prior directives have been made and are reflected in the appropriate files.
- Logging standards now specify how logs should be structured to ensure they are testable and observable.
- Test coverage for feature generation is complete.
- Test log capture methods have been corrected.
- Test coverage for the `apply_strategy` function has been expanded to include comprehensive tests for different column names, empty DataFrames, DataFrames with NaNs, logging verification, and ensuring the original DataFrame is not modified.
- The design documentation for the `generate_features` function in `feature_generator.py` has been updated to match the implemented behavior. The function uses a `feature_config` dictionary approach rather than the originally designed `strategy_params` approach, providing better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation.
- The data loading interface has been consolidated by enhancing the `fetch_data` function with the additional capabilities from the `fetch` function (column selection and cache control). The `fetch` function is now a backward-compatibility wrapper around `fetch_data`. All relevant documentation has been updated to reflect this change.
