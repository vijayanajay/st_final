## RESOLVED ISSUES

### TEST-001: Incomplete Test Coverage for Feature Generation
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolution Summary:** As of 2025-05-19, 100% test coverage is achieved for all current and future functions in `feature_generator.py`. All edge cases and error handling are covered in `tests/test_feature_generator.py`. A process is in place to require new features to be accompanied by new tests. Recommend enforcing coverage via CI or pre-commit hook for all business logic modules.
- **Date Resolved:** 2025-05-19

### LOG-001: Absence of Logging in Core Modules
- **Status:** RESOLVED (Updated 2025-05-20)
- **Description:** `src/data_loader.py` and `src/feature_generator.py` lacked structured logging for key operations and error conditions. This impeded observability and debugging.
- **Resolution Summary:** Structured logging has been added to all error conditions and critical operations in all core modules. Logging configuration is centralized in `configs/logging_config.py`. Documentation has been updated to reflect this. All new modules and functions must include structured logging as per project policy.
- **Date Resolved:** 2025-05-20
- **Required Action:** None

### TEST-002: Test Log Capture Method
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Description:** Tests for log messages using pytest's `caplog` fixture were failing because they incorrectly accessed log records through `caplog.text` instead of `caplog.records`.
- **Resolution Summary:** Tests now properly access individual log records via `caplog.records` and check message attributes for expected substrings. Documentation has been added to `docs/src/config_parser.py.md` about the proper way to capture and assert log messages in tests.
- **Date Resolved:** 2025-05-20
- **Required Action:** None
