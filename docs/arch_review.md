## NEW CRITICAL FLAWS (Identified This Audit)

**TEST-006:** Test Code Quality Degradation in `tests/test_data_loader.py`. The test file contained two nearly identical, extensive sets of tests: one for the legacy `fetch` function and one for the primary `fetch_data` function. This violated the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, leading to significant code duplication and increased maintenance overhead.

**Flaw Impact:** Medium-High - Any change to the data loading logic required updating two sets of tests, increasing the risk of them becoming inconsistent. It bloated the test suite and made it harder to read and maintain.

**Root Cause:** When `fetch_data` was introduced as the primary function, its tests were created by copy-pasting the tests for the `fetch` function, without refactoring to eliminate the redundancy.

**Mandated Solution:** 
1. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Retained the comprehensive test suite for the primary `fetch_data` function
2. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Removed all redundant tests for the `fetch` function (e.g., `test_fetch_validates_ticker`, `test_fetch_validates_period`, `test_fetch_caching`, etc.)
3. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Kept only the single, targeted test `test_fetch_delegates_to_fetch_data` to ensure the wrapper correctly calls the primary function

**Systemic Prevention:** Code review checklists must include a point to specifically check for test code duplication when a legacy API is being wrapped by a new one.

**DOC-001:** Documentation Veracity Failure in `docs/tasks.md`. Tasks 20, 21, and 22 in the Backtester Module were marked as incomplete [ ] despite being fully implemented in `src/backtester.py` with comprehensive test coverage. This documentation inconsistency violated the Core Engineering Principle #6 requiring that documentation accurately reflects the codebase state.

**Flaw Impact:** High - Misleads developers about implementation status, undermines documentation trustworthiness, and violates the explicit directive that documentation must be a truthful representation of the codebase.

**Root Cause:** Task completion status was not updated when implementation was completed, indicating insufficient synchronization between code implementation and documentation maintenance.

**Mandated Solution:** 
1. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Updated `docs/tasks.md` to mark Tasks 20, 21, 22 as complete with detailed completion descriptions
2. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Updated progress summary to reflect correct completion count (22/30 = 73% vs 19/30 = 63%)
3. **REQUIRED** - Implement systemic prevention measures to ensure documentation-code synchronization

**Systemic Prevention:** Mandatory pre-commit/CI checks must verify that:
- Task completion status in `docs/tasks.md` matches actual implementation status
- Progress summaries accurately reflect completion counts
- All completed tasks have corresponding implementation and test evidence

## RESOLVED CRITICAL FLAWS (This Audit)

**TEST-006 (RESOLVED):** Test Code Quality Degradation in `tests/test_data_loader.py`. The test file contained two nearly identical sets of tests for `fetch` and `fetch_data` functions. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Removed all redundant tests for `fetch` function, kept only a single test to verify delegation to `fetch_data`.

**DOC-001 (RESOLVED):** Documentation Veracity Failure in `docs/tasks.md`. Tasks 20, 21, and 22 were incorrectly marked as incomplete despite full implementation. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Task statuses updated, progress summary corrected, systemic prevention measures mandated.

**CODE-001 (RESOLVED):** Code Duplication in `src/backtester.py`. The `PortfolioData` NamedTuple was defined twice, identically, within the file. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Removed the duplicate definition while maintaining all functionality and test coverage.

**API-001 (RESOLVED):** Architectural Degeneration in Test Suite. The test suite for feature generator primarily targeted legacy alias functions (calculate_*) instead of designated primary API functions (add_*). ✅ **RESOLVED** - The tests have been refactored to directly call the primary add_* functions, with separate minimal tests for legacy function delegation.

## AUDIT NOTES
- All code and documentation changes related to prior directives have been made and are reflected in the appropriate files.
- Logging standards now specify how logs should be structured to ensure they are testable and observable.
- Test coverage for feature generation is complete.
- Test log capture methods have been corrected.
- Tests for feature generation have been refactored to use static, pre-calculated expected values rather than dynamic recalculation, ensuring independent verification of function correctness.
- Tests for feature generation have been further refactored to directly target the primary API functions (add_*) instead of legacy aliases (calculate_*).
- The design documentation for the `generate_features` function in `feature_generator.py` has been updated to match the implemented behavior. The function uses a `feature_config` dictionary approach rather than the originally designed `strategy_params` approach, providing better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation.
- The data loading interface has been consolidated by enhancing the `fetch_data` function with the additional capabilities from the `fetch` function (column selection and cache control). The `fetch` function is now a backward-compatibility wrapper around `fetch_data`. All relevant documentation has been updated to reflect this change.
- Test imports in `test_backtester.py` have been standardized to use proper Python module imports rather than dynamic imports, improving code clarity and maintainability.
- Test assertions in `test_backtester.py` have been made more precise, ensuring they match the exact expected behavior of the backtesting logic. In particular, portfolio composition tracking assertions now verify exact values (0% cash/100% equity when in position) rather than using less precise comparisons.
- Test code duplication in `test_data_loader.py` has been eliminated by removing redundant tests for the legacy `fetch` function and keeping only one test that verifies the wrapper behavior. This significantly reduced code duplication while maintaining comprehensive test coverage of the primary `fetch_data` function.
