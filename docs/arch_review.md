## RESOLVED ISSUES

All previously documented architectural directives (TEST-001, LOG-001, TEST-002) were confirmed as RESOLVED as of 2025-05-20. The TEST-003 issue identified on 2025-05-23 has been RESOLVED. The DESIGN-001 issue related to feature generation orchestration identified on 2025-05-23 has been RESOLVED. The TEST-004 issue related to suboptimal test implementation has been RESOLVED. The IMPORT-001 issue related to non-standard import practices in test_backtester.py has been RESOLVED. Refer to `resolved_issues.md` for details.

## PARTIALLY RESOLVED/REGRESSED ISSUES

_None at this time._

## NEW CRITICAL FLAWS (Identified This Audit)

**TEST-004 (RESOLVED):** Suboptimal Test Implementation in `test_feature_generator.py`. The test dynamically recalculated expected values for `calculate_volatility` and `calculate_price_change_pct` within the test execution flow instead of comparing against static, pre-defined expected values. This issue has been RESOLVED by refactoring all tests to use static, pre-calculated expected values rather than dynamic recalculation.

**API-001 (RESOLVED):** Dual Interfaces and Documentation Mismatch in `data_loader.py`. Two similar public functions (`fetch_data` and `fetch`) existed with disparate feature sets, potentially causing API confusion for developers. The officially designed `fetch_data` function in `docs/design.md` lacked the enhanced capabilities of the `fetch` function. This issue has been RESOLVED by enhancing `fetch_data` to include all capabilities of `fetch` (column selection, cache control), making `fetch` a thin wrapper around `fetch_data` for backward compatibility, and updating all relevant documentation.

**ERR-001 (RESOLVED):** Column Name Conflict Handling in `feature_generator.py`. The `_add_feature` function did not properly handle column name conflicts when joining features to the DataFrame, which could result in silent overwriting of existing columns. This issue has been RESOLVED by implementing proper column conflict resolution that renames columns with sequential suffixes when conflicts occur, with appropriate logging of these actions.

**ARCH-001 (RESOLVED):** Architectural Inconsistency in Strategy Implementation. The `apply_strategy` function used a hardcoded if/else structure to handle different strategy types, which did not leverage the existing `BaseStrategy` class intended for a Strategy pattern implementation. This issue has been RESOLVED by properly implementing the Strategy pattern: defining a clear interface in `BaseStrategy` with abstract methods, creating concrete strategy implementations (e.g., `SMACrossoverStrategy`), implementing a strategy registry for dynamic instantiation, and refactoring `apply_strategy` to use this pattern. The `generate_sma_crossover_signals` function has been maintained for backward compatibility but now uses the new `SMACrossoverStrategy` internally.

**IMPORT-001 (RESOLVED):** Non-Standard Import Practices in `tests/test_backtester.py`. The test file used dynamic imports (importlib.util.spec_from_file_location) to load the backtester.py module from the src/ directory, making the test setup less standard and potentially more brittle. This issue has been RESOLVED by updating the test file to use standard import statements (from src import backtester) consistent with the project's structure and Python import conventions.

---

## RESOLVED CRITICAL FLAWS (This Audit)

**DESIGN-001 (RESOLVED):** Design Deviation & Documentation Mismatch for Feature Generation Orchestration. The `generate_features` function in `src/feature_generator.py` was implemented with a different signature and behavior than specified in `docs/design.md`. This issue has been RESOLVED by updating the design documentation to match the implemented behavior, which was determined to be superior to the original design.

## AUDIT NOTES
- All code and documentation changes related to prior directives have been made and are reflected in the appropriate files.
- Logging standards now specify how logs should be structured to ensure they are testable and observable.
- Test coverage for feature generation is complete.
- Test log capture methods have been corrected.
- Tests for feature generation have been refactored to use static, pre-calculated expected values rather than dynamic recalculation, ensuring independent verification of function correctness.
- The design documentation for the `generate_features` function in `feature_generator.py` has been updated to match the implemented behavior. The function uses a `feature_config` dictionary approach rather than the originally designed `strategy_params` approach, providing better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation.
- The data loading interface has been consolidated by enhancing the `fetch_data` function with the additional capabilities from the `fetch` function (column selection and cache control). The `fetch` function is now a backward-compatibility wrapper around `fetch_data`. All relevant documentation has been updated to reflect this change.
- Test imports in `test_backtester.py` have been standardized to use proper Python module imports rather than dynamic imports, improving code clarity and maintainability.
