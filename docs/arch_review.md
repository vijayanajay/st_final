## PARTIALLY RESOLVED/REGRESSED ISSUES

_None at this time._

## NEW CRITICAL FLAWS (Identified This Audit)

**DOC-001:** Documentation Veracity Failure in `docs/tasks.md`. Tasks 20, 21, and 22 in the Backtester Module were marked as incomplete [ ] despite being fully implemented in `src/backtester.py` with comprehensive test coverage. This documentation inconsistency violated the Core Engineering Principle #6 requiring that documentation accurately reflects the codebase state.

**Flaw Impact:** High - Misleads developers about implementation status, undermines documentation trustworthiness, and violates the explicit directive that documentation must be a truthful representation of the codebase.

**Root Cause:** Task completion status was not updated when implementation was completed, indicating insufficient synchronization between code implementation and documentation maintenance.

**Mandated Solution:** 
1. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Updated `docs/tasks.md` to mark Tasks 20, 21, 22 as complete with detailed completion descriptions
2. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Updated progress summary to reflect correct completion count (22/30 = 73% vs 19/30 = 63%)
3. **REQUIRED** - Implement systemic prevention measures to ensure documentation-code synchronization

**Systemic Prevention:** Mandatory pre-commit/CI checks must verify that:
- Task completion status in `docs/tasks.md` matches actual implementation status
- Progress summaries accurately reflect completion counts
- All completed tasks have corresponding implementation and test evidence

## RESOLVED CRITICAL FLAWS (This Audit)

**DOC-001 (RESOLVED):** Documentation Veracity Failure in `docs/tasks.md`. Tasks 20, 21, and 22 were incorrectly marked as incomplete despite full implementation. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Task statuses updated, progress summary corrected, systemic prevention measures mandated.

**CODE-001 (RESOLVED):** Code Duplication in `src/backtester.py`. The `PortfolioData` NamedTuple was defined twice, identically, within the file. ✅ **RESOLVED** - Removed the duplicate definition while maintaining all functionality and test coverage.

## AUDIT NOTES
- All code and documentation changes related to prior directives have been made and are reflected in the appropriate files.
- Logging standards now specify how logs should be structured to ensure they are testable and observable.
- Test coverage for feature generation is complete.
- Test log capture methods have been corrected.
- Tests for feature generation have been refactored to use static, pre-calculated expected values rather than dynamic recalculation, ensuring independent verification of function correctness.
- The design documentation for the `generate_features` function in `feature_generator.py` has been updated to match the implemented behavior. The function uses a `feature_config` dictionary approach rather than the originally designed `strategy_params` approach, providing better separation of concerns and more flexibility in feature generation.
- The data loading interface has been consolidated by enhancing the `fetch_data` function with the additional capabilities from the `fetch` function (column selection and cache control). The `fetch` function is now a backward-compatibility wrapper around `fetch_data`. All relevant documentation has been updated to reflect this change.
- Test imports in `test_backtester.py` have been standardized to use proper Python module imports rather than dynamic imports, improving code clarity and maintainability.
- Test assertions in `test_backtester.py` have been made more precise, ensuring they match the exact expected behavior of the backtesting logic. In particular, portfolio composition tracking assertions now verify exact values (0% cash/100% equity when in position) rather than using less precise comparisons.
