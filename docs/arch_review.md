## RESOLVED ISSUES

### TEST-001: Incomplete Test Coverage for Feature Generation
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolution Summary:** As of 2025-05-19, 100% test coverage is achieved for all current and future functions in `feature_generator.py`. All edge cases and error handling are covered in `tests/test_feature_generator.py`. A process is in place to require new features to be accompanied by new tests. Recommend enforcing coverage via CI or pre-commit hook for all business logic modules.
- **Date Resolved:** 2025-05-19

### LOG-001: Absence of Logging in Core Modules
- **Status:** UNRESOLVED
- **Description:** `src/data_loader.py` and `src/feature_generator.py` lack structured logging for key operations and error conditions. This impedes observability and debugging.
- **Required Action:**
    1. Add structured logging (using the standard library `logging` module) to all critical operations and error paths in these modules.
    2. Centralize logging configuration in `configs/logging_config.py`.
    3. Mandate logging for all new modules and functions.
