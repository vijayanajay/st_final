# `strategies.py` Module Documentation

## Overview
The `src/strategies.py` module is intended to house the various trading strategy implementations for the Simple Stock Strategy Backtester (S3B).

It will define a `BaseStrategy` class from which all specific strategies will inherit, ensuring a common interface for strategy evaluation.

## Current Structure

- **Methods:** (To be defined as strategies are developed)

## Future Enhancements
