## DOC-SYNC-001: Documentation-Code Synchronization Automation
**Date Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Criticality:** Medium  
**Description:** Manual verification of documentation-code synchronization is error-prone as evidenced by DOC-001 (tasks.md veracity failure). The mandated systemic prevention requires automated CI/CD checks to verify that task completion status matches implementation reality.

**Justification:** Implementing comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with documentation verification scripts is beyond current v0.1 scope but essential for production readiness.

**Remediation Plan:** 
- Phase 1 (Post-v0.1): Create scripts to verify task status against implementation evidence
- Phase 2: Integrate verification into pre-commit hooks  
- Phase 3: Add CI/CD pipeline checks for documentation-code alignment

**Impact if Deferred:** Risk of future documentation veracity failures, though manual review processes can mitigate in near-term.
